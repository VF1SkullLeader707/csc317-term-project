# OrbitCart — Aerospace Components Marketplace (CSC 317)

OrbitCart is a mock aerospace parts e-commerce platform developed as a course
project for **CSC 317: Web Software Development** at **San Francisco State
University**.

The application simulates a full shopping experience where users can browse
products, manage a cart, log in, save items, and complete a **simulated checkout
flow**. No real payments or personal financial data are used.
